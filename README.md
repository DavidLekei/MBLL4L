## About

Using publicly available data from the Manitoba Law Society, this site serves as a wrapper around their 'Manitoba Lawyer Lookup'.
This site is specifically tailored towards use by law firms, as they commonly need to generate lists of other lawyers in the province.

## TODOs

Ability to create an account, which will allow users to do the following:
    - Export to different file types (XML, JSON, etc.).
    - Save search terms/filters/etc. instead of resetting them everytime they come back.
    - Access the API and corresponding documentation
    - View more detailed information about each Lawyer (maybe)
    - Change settings (Pagination vs infinite scroll, light vs dark mode, etc.).
    - More to come
